##Project philosophy

###Free for all
The app is and will be free to use for everyone. It's open source project and you can involve in its development.

###Easy to use
As a UX designer and developer I promise to develop easiest to use tool from them all. Every part of the UI and app's functionality is based on real users requirements. All you can find there is what you really need to work with REST services.

###Quality and stability
The app should work as desired. I take it serious if it comes to release and I've prepared complex testing and releasing process so the final release should be free of bugs.
If you however find a bug in the released version, please, [file a bug report][issue_tracker] on project's Github page.
